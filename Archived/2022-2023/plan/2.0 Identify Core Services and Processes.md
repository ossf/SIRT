## Summary

Section Two seeks to take inputs from [Section One](https://github.com/ossf/SIRT/blob/main/plan/1.0%20Understand%20the%20Problem%20Space.md) and synthesize a group of services that the OSS-SIRT will offer to open source communities and the ecosystem. An initial list of services are defined for the first year of operations, with feedback being reviewed periodically to adjust the services for Year Two and beyond. Section Two also focuses on the creation of playbooks and procedures that the OSS-SIRT will follow with their engagements. Based on the Year One services the OSS-SIRT offers, volunteer staffing recomendations will be input into [Section Three](https://github.com/ossf/SIRT/blob/main/plan/3.0%20Execution.md) for execution of the plan and recruiting of the volunteer cohort.

## 2.1 Identify Core Services

The OSS-SIRT will define the minimum set of core services it will initially offer and propose future service offerings based on the usage, experience, and of the SIRT. This service set will be derived from the output of Section 1 survey. The internal processes and procedures for the OSS-SIRT's execution and completion of these services as well as the external guidance for using these services will consider the results of that survey to ensure appropriate communications and engagement paths meet the need of the target user base (open source projects). In order to ensure smooth execution, the SIRT will perform a tabletop exercise and walkthrough of these services and procedures against two different types of open source security incidents.

Dependent upon 2.1 and the survey variability.

### Key Steps and Milestones

- **M1**: Estimate operational case distribution for at least first year (~1 month calendar time)

  - [ ] Define the sources of trend data (CNCF, GitHub, MITRE, etc.)
  - [ ] Evaluate 5 year trend of incident types
  - [ ] Group/pattern the incident types that occur leveraging existing body of work

- **M2**: Develop internal SIRT procedures for services ~6 weeks

  - [ ] For each service, define the intake criteria, engagement (whether to do so & prioritization), and closure criteria
    - [ ] Includes initial assessment (triage)
    - [ ] Includes prioritization and risk assessment
  - [ ] For each service, enumerate the procedures, timeliness estimates, and communication expectations ~4 weeks
  - [ ] For each service, define the input and outputs

- **M3**: External facing guidance for services ~3 weeks

  - [ ] For each service, define a tl;dr of what it is
  - [ ] For each service, define a 'why'
  - [ ] For each service, define the expectations a user of the service may reasonably experience with timeline estimates/best effort milestones

- **M4**: Testing period (tabletop some services/procedures/guidance through past incidents) ~3 weeks

  - [ ] Identify two different open source incidents to run through against a service or series of services
  - [ ] Execute the tabletop against the intake, procedures, and communications
  - [ ] Conduct a blameless post-mortem on the execution of the tabletop against the intake, procedures, and communications
  - [ ] Identify refinement areas in the SIRT's execution and update accordingly

    - [ ] Examples: oss-security, distros, OSS foundations, OSS hosting/infrastructure providers (yes like GitHub)

- **M9**: Determine legal issues, seek advice (from LF/OpenSSF)

  - [ ] Define a list of potential legal concern areas
  - [ ] Contact OpenSSF to ensure the SIRT, maintainers, etc. is covered legally, insurance, codes of conduct, need-to-know, hypocratic oath, etc.

- **M10**: Develop volunteer requirements

  - [ ] Ethical, code of conduct, other agreements
  - [ ] Define volunteering processes & rules, the upholding of commitments upheld by incident responders (including preventing premature disclosure “How-to” guides for those maintainers/developers wishing to engage with the SIRT), service level agreements (SLAs), and the definition a process fore engagement/interactions with Distros, & oss-security & existing security teams.

- **M11**: Re-evaluate processes, criteria, etc. after year 1
  - [ ] For each service, comprehensive assessment on value and usability of the criteria, processes, procedures, communications, etc are determined to continue, modify, or drop

## 2.4 Community Engagement

<img align="right" src="https://github.com/ossf/SIRT/blob/main/plan/oss-sirt%20inputs-outputs.png">

Several different pathways into the OSS-SIRT will need to be accounted for:

<img align="center" src="https://github.com/ossf/SIRT/blob/main/plan/SIRT-Finder-sirt-main.png">
The first use case of engagement would come from Finders (Security Researchers or similair) who have discovered a vulnerability they are trying to report, but are experiencing challenges in finding the appropriate project Maintainer.  Here the OSS-SIRT should be able to broker a connection by identifying the appropriate mechanism or community to report the vulnerability to.

<img align="center" src="https://github.com/ossf/SIRT/blob/main/plan/SIRT-Finder-Maint-SIRT.png">
The next engagement scenario could arise from situations where a Maintainer is contacted by a Finder and they are having challenges moving forward and therefore the Maintainer reaches out to the OSS-SIRT for some form of assistance in working with the Finder.

<img align="center" src="https://github.com/ossf/SIRT/blob/main/plan/SIRT-Finder-Consumer.png">
The next scenario that could come up would be when a Finder is unable to find a Maintainer and engages directly with the OSS-SIRT for assistance in notifying downstream consumers about the flaw.  



### 2.4.1 Outreach to Developer Communities

**:spiral_notepad: Note**: Depends on 2.1

Through discussing our proposal with a representative set of open-source developers and security incident responders, with special attention to those with experience managing the disclosure and remediation of high impact vulnerabilities in open-source software.

This work should also be done in coordination with the Outreach team at OpenSSF.
