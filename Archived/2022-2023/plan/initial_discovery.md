# Initial Discovery

## Randall T. Vasquez

An initial high-level summary of these problems is as follows. It will be leveraged to verify that the services offered to address the issues are reasonable and appropriate.

- There exists open source projects and communities that are culturally adverse to applying security changes as the software they make available makes no guarantees, is hobbyist, or is not intended to become critical.

- Security implementation is often a single point of failure; lack of like knowledge in that domain as it applies to projects means that code or configuration cannot be maintained (becoming a security problem unto itself).

- “My adopters should know better” as a decision to exclude or not include least privilege, protections, or security design concepts made sense 20 years ago when innovation and commoditization of the technology was very early (high risk). Still, as adoptions have exponentially increased, this mindset cannot necessarily persist. This is exacerbated by either the lack of documentation on assumed knowledge or developers not reading documentation - choosing to focus on shipping with velocity.

- Open source projects and languages exist in their silos, so communication inter-silo doesn’t occur. When incidents occur, there is no method for delivering messaging across silos. Like the lack of interstate scores ago, the CDC needs to distribute vaccines across the country in one week.
