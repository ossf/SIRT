## Risks and Challenges

> - Community may be slow in uptake of OSS-SIRT's services
> - Community may not accept OSS-SIRT's services
> - Community response may be greater than anticipated
> - Volunteer cohort may be challenging to get members to commit to (dedicating staff for dedicate upstream work may conflict with current duties)
> - Volunteer cohort member could inadvertently break embargo of incident being coordinated through OSS-SIRT
> - OSS-SIRT may not be able to find maintainer/project for reported vulnerability

Footnotes:
[^1]: The Direct Services position is optional and not explicitly described in the plan details. The position is intended to provide a minimum level of operational support and continuity to mitigate potential variability in Volunteer efforts. Effort provided by position would be counted against Volunteer effort under [3. Execution](proposal_summary.md#3-execution) and hiring effort would be equivalent to that described in [3.1 Hire Program Manager for OSS-SIRT](3.0%20Execution.md#31-hire-program-manager-for-oss-sirt).
