# OpenSSF OSS-SIRT Special Interest Group (SIG)

[![GitHub Super-Linter](https://github.com/ossf/sirt/workflows/Lint%20Code%20Base/badge.svg)](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/super-linter)

The OSS-SIRT SIG (Open Source Software Security Incident Response Team Special Interest Group) is a group working within the OSSF's Vulnerability Disclosure Working Group that is focused on creating secure vulnerability management capabilities within the open source ecosystem to ensure effective coordinated vulnerability disclosure practices (CVD) for all. The group will be a coordinated group of experts from across the industry who will be available to help
open source maintainers with all aspects of remediating high-impact security vulnerabilities and related security emergencies

## Motivation

Historically, Open Source maintainers and end users have depended on a circle of trust to distribute and consume Open Source Software safely. Over the last several years, this concept has proven to be problematic and sub-optimal by itself with the increase of attacks targeting open source maintainers as well as the components they create and maintain. Effectively, these problems have illustrated additional effort and work are required to ensure that both Consumers and End Users of maintainers are consuming Open Source Software safely while still, having their needs met with the least friction to their overall intent and objective in maintaining their software. As it presently stands, this type of work traditionally is the responsibility of a project's Maintainer group; however, frequently, the Maintainer(s) already lack sufficient resources to address their own needs adequately let alone take on the additional work being asked of them to develop and provide their open source component in a secure manner acceptable to anyone using it. Piling on more work to the already stressed pipeline and burdened maintainers often results in Security not being prioritized until a Security issue becomes the forefront, which is often too late for a project's Consumers and End Users.

This SIRT's motivation is to make available the incident response resources to assist Open Source Software communities, downstream consumers, and vulnerability management ecosystems in addressing their current and upcoming Security issues, vulnerabilities, incidents, and the processes necessary for their execution. We intend to deliver service offerings to projects that provide an additional support arm against incidents, like `log4shell`, which are otherwise not available to these projects. We hope these efforts will assist in addressing critical and time-sensitive Security issues across the Open Source Software communities that participate in the program.

## Objective

[What is to be achieved with this initiative]

[OKRs - OPTIONAL]

## Scope

[What is in and out of scope]
To develop a cohort of trustworthy, vendor-neutral, vetted, well-orchestrated and experienced group of security professionals

**_EXPRESSLY OUT OF SCOPE:_**

- Anything involving vulnerabilities in closed-source/proprietary software
- Security improvements to open-source software that are not tactically essential to the
  patching of newly-reported, high- and critical-impact vulnerabilities in open-source
  software
- Helping projects or individual enterprises with remediating their security exposures
  from another open-source projectâ€™s security vulnerabilities
