## Summary

This section outlines the steps to collect feedback, existing precident, and good industry practices that are used to coordinate security vulnerabilities. The goals and milestones outlined here help inform the creation of OSS-SIRT services in [section 2](https://github.com/ossf/SIRT/blob/main/plan/2.0%20Identify%20Core%20Services%20and%20Processes.md) and ultimately the recruiting of the cohort as outlined in [section 3](https://github.com/ossf/SIRT/blob/main/plan/3.0%20Execution.md). Section 1 engages with upstream maintainers, security teams, and security researchers to tailor the capabilities the OSS-SIRT will ultimately deliver so they are fit-for-purpose and useful to the targted stakeholders.

## 1.1 Understand and Document the Problem Space

For the OSS-SIRT to narrow and define the breadth of services it will offer, we must first understand the current problems expressed by the various types of open source projects.

There is a wide range of security issues and complications that Open Source projects and maintainers consistently face. Therefore, we intend to lead with discussions with a diverse set of representative open source developers and security incident responders, paying particular attention to those with experience in managing the disclosure and remediation of high-impact vulnerabilities (such as log4j) in open source software.

From these discussions, we intend to create surveys to be distributed to a greater number of representative open source projects to help us better understand their needs.

## 1.2 Survey the OSS-SIRT's Intended Audience

After having a good intial understanding of the problems we're aiming to address (1.1), we will develop a set of questions to futher gather feedback and understanding from the OSS-SIRT's intended audience.

### Key Steps/Milestones

- [ ] **M1**: Develop Questions
- [ ] **M2**: Gather SIG Feedback
- [ ] **M3**: Coordination within OSSF SIGs
- [ ] **M4**: Solicit Feedback
- [ ] **M5**: Analyze Results
  - While Anylzing results, it would be useful to start indentifing potential Stakeholders for 1.4.
- [ ] **M6**: Develop Report
- [ ] **M7**: Reviewing services

### Time & Resource Estimate

This will require coordination with the OpenSSF to develop the survey based on this top level problem set. It will then require the SIG to comb through the analysis of this data set and develop a guiding report for development and feature-completeness of services.

## 1.3 Update OSS-SIRT Charter

After completing the surveies (and their anaylsises), it is important to update the charter, indentifing, describing, and documenting the basic program elements under which the OSS-SIRT will operate.

[Initial Discovery](initial_discovery.md)

### Key Steps/Milestones

- [ ] **M1**: Document and Define Personas
  - The Vunlerability Disclosures Working Group is working on establishing some personas that can be of use, abeit with maybe some minor modifications.
- [ ] **M2**: Document and Define OSS-SIRT's Mission in `CHARTER.md`
- [ ] **M3**: Document and Define OSS-SIRT's Purpose, Roles, and Responsiblities in `CHARTER.md`
- [ ] **M4**: Review OSS-SIRT's `CHARTER.md` document (after Year One)

### Time & Resource Estimate

| Milestone | Estimated Volunteers | Estimated Individual Hours | Estimated Total Hours | Stage |
| :-------: | :------------------: | :------------------------: | :-------------------: | :---: |
|    M1     |         3-4          |           16-32            |        48-128         | ➡️ Y1 |
|    M2     |         SIG          |            2-3             |         10-16         | ➡️ Y1 |
|    M3     |         SIG          |            3-4             |         15-20         | ➡️ Y1 |
|    M4     |         SIG          |            1-2             |         5-10          | 🔚 Y1 |

## 1.4 Define the OSS-SIRT's Stakeholders

Prior to formally providing these services, the OSS-SIRT must first identify the unique stakeholders that are relevant.

![oss-sirt-relation](oss-sirt-relation.png)

Activities done in 1.2 might provide some guidance on potential Stakeholders.

### Key Steps/Milestones

- [ ] **M1**: Document and Define Upstream (Developer) Communities and Partners in `CHARTER.md`
- [ ] **M2**: Document and Define Downstream (Consumer/Distribution) Communities and Partners in `CHARTER.md`
- [ ] **M3**: Document Relevant Security Vendors
  - Knowing and properly engaging with security vendors can speed communications and efforts around vulnerability reporting/remediation as they report issues to the OSS-SIRT. _It is important to understand what these vendors will have access to and keep._
  - The OSS-SIRT's relationship to the bug bounty vendor should be thoroughly documented and vetted prior to entering into a relationship so that all involved parties understand how they should behave, what resources they can access, how data is shared, and with whom it is shared.
  - [ ] **M3a**: Document and Define Methods to Engage with Security Vendors
