## 1.1 Understand and document the problem space

Explanation: In order for the SIRT to narrow and define the breadth of services it offers, we must first understand the current problems as expressed by the various types of open source projects. To that end, an initial high level summary of these problems is as follows and will be leveraged to verify the services offered assist in addressing the problems where reasonable and appropriate.

* There exists open source projects and communities that are culturally adverse to applying security changes as the software they make available makes no guarantees, is hobbyist, or is not intended to become critical.
* Security implementation is often a single point of failure, lack of like knowledge in that domain as it applies to projects means that code or configuration is not capable of being maintained (becoming a security problem unto itself)
* “My adopters should know better” as a decision to exclude or not include least privilege, protections, or security design concepts made sense 20 years ago when innovation and commoditization of the technology was very early (high risk) but in as adoptions has exponentially increase, this mindset cannot necessarily persists. This is exacerbated by either the lack of documentation on assummed knowledge, or by developers not reading documentation - choosing to focus on shipping with velocity.
* Open source projects, and languages exist in their own silos, so communication inter-silo doesn’t occur. When incidents occur, there is no method for delivering messaging across silos. Like the lack of interstates scores ago, and the CDC needs to distribute vaccines across the country in one week.

#### Survey Format
The survey would take form as a guided discussion. There may be a Google Form or some other tooling to help use save and archive the information. Questions for these surveys will be prepared in this [Google Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p1a10Yp356gLgRCj5ksNnkaRW7N-MW02kgABsbGAq2Y/edit?usp=sharing). All question that will be considered for the intial survey by Nov. 14, 2022.

#### Time & resource estimate

This will require coordination with the OpenSSF to develop the survey based on this top level problem set. It will then require the SIG to comb through the analysis of this data set and develop a guiding report for development and feature-completeness of services.

| Task | Estimated Volunteers | Estimated Individual Hours | Estimated Task Hours | Stage | External Contributors Required |
| ---- | -------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------- | ----- | ------------------------------ |
| Develop Questions | ~5 | 2~3 | 10~16 | Start (Year 1) | |
| Gather SIG Feedback | ~5 | ~2 | ~10 | Start (Year 1) | |
| Coordination within OSSF SIGs | ~2 | | ~16  | Start (Year 1) | |
| Solicit Feedback (per Project) | ~2 | ~4 | * | Start (Year 1) | |
| Analyze Results (Work + Meeting Time) | ~5 | ~2 + (1 + 1) |  ~22 | Start (Year 1) | |
| Develop Report | ~2 | 8~12 | 16~14 | Start (Year 1) | |
| Reviewing services (with the other SIRT streams) | ** | 1 | ~20 | End (Year 1) | | 

 Total: ~114 hours

#### Goal

The goal of these surveys is to capture the different view (and pain) points from different open source mantainers and security personal. We want to get a good overall landscape view (and learn from) these teams.

## 1.2 procedures around outreach to dev communities about our services

(Dependant on 2.1)

Explanation: through discussing our proposal with a representative set of open-source developers and security incident responders, with special attention to those with experience managing the disclosure and remediation of high impact vulnerabilities in open-source software.
