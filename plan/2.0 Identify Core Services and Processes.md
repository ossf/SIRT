## 2.1 - Core services
### Explanation
Services the SIRT should offer. Organize by core/optional, year 1/year N?

### Key steps and milestones

#### More predictable
- Integrate results of Section 1 survey (1 month)

Develop internal SIRT procedures for services ~6 weeks

External facing guidance for services ~3 weeks

Testing period (tabletop some services/procedures/guidance through past incidents) ~2 weeks




#### Less predictable
Responding to incidents (handling incidents, events, cases) is significantly driven by external forces. This is still somewhat predictable, but has significant variability. Milestones include:

- Estimate incident distribution, consider adh work, "t-shirt sizing"
- Decide distribution of incidents SIRT expects to work on and resource needs
- Decide selection criteria (intake, triage, accceptance)
- Decide resource estimates per case type and frequency

For diversity, reslience, quality (and possibly other reasons), roughly expect 3-7 individuals per incident, with ideally 2 as an absolute minimum.

Recommend core services for year 1

Support acceptably secure communications

Coordinate and negotiate vulnerability disclosures among stakeholders

Stakeholders include:

* Maintainers, developers, suppliers, vendors
* Researchers, reporters
* Users

SIRT mission/ROE should include such things (move this up SIRT SIG) ~3 hours

  * Public safety organizations, community at large, the world are a subset of users, not a direct stakeholder consideration?
  * are there legal/regulatory reporting concerns? --> OpenSSF (Art does not think there are :)
  * a comment somewhere (possibly higher up around a mission statement?) that offensive users of vulnerabilities are *not* a specfied stakeholder? The SIRT is the bluest of blue teams? Any other specific non-stakeholders?

Coordination includes:

* Notifications to other parties
* Timelines, particularly public disclosure
* Information management (strive to provide consistent and accurate information)
 * Write or assist in writing advisories, vulnerability catalog entries (CVE, GVSD, osv.dev), release notes, and other vulnerability documentation, focusing on assessment and actions needed by users

Vulnerability assessment

This is not optional, the SIRT must at least perform sufficent assessment to determine whether or not to engage (see triage/engagement).

(optional) The SIRT can experiment with providing subject matter experts (SME) to help with vetting and offering security expertise in order to help maintainers better understand the vulnerabilities and their impact. Both technological (e.g., PoC) and broader risk aspects (ubiquity, supply chain impact, likelihood, etc.).

(optional) Review proposed fixes before they are public to see if they fully resolve the reported vulnerabilities (related to technological assessment/PoC).

(optional) Assist in creation, review, testing of proposed fixes.
 
For year one, the SIRT will provide guidance and best practices documentation to maintainers on how to evaluate vulnerability reports in their open source project and react to zero-day exploitation reports.  Part of this is covered in 2.1 and 1.3

For year two (actual time: all the stacked prep time, section 1.*, 2.1, etc) and later, we will expand and start helping to evaluate and assist maintainers receiving reports of novel vulnerabilities and in-the-wild exploitation of vulnerabilities in their open source project. Depends on 1.3

(dicsuss) Suggestion to provide response services right away (year 1), this is perhaps the question of balance between education and more direct response service (education is also a service).

### Time and resources estimate
This is going to be somewhat tricky.

Produce X educational/guidance materials is easy to estimate.

Direct response service is harder and depends on a number of inputs, including external events that are hard to precisely predict.

* What response sevices does the SIRT offer?
* What kinds of events do those services support?
* How many events of which type will occur?
* How many events will the SIRT take on?
* Availability of resources, paid and volunteer

This is a typical problem for emergency response activities, e.g., EMT resources are idle a lot (well not really, they train, prepare, patrol, etc.) but when a big event happens, you don't want to find out you're 50% short-staffed. Volunteer EMT models seem to work, but require the volunteers to be ready and committed to step in when needed.

overflow and underflow of resource needs

* ability to quickly staff up, call OpenSSF/LF members for volunteers, expect 10-12 hours of onboarding time
* In SIRT terms, staff can work on relatively lower priority cases or projects but be prepared to switch to high priority cases when needed, volunteers can return to their day jobs

per case/event/incident resource estimates TBD, related to service choices, expected distribution, intake/criteria

expectation: some core/FT staff, at least program management, expect volunteer responders


## 2.2 Engagement model
(was: Design an engagement model for incident responders, which addresses things such as)

Much of this depends on or is interlinked with the Services section.

### Explanation

### Key steps and milestones



Decide services (2.1)

Decide SIRT event documetation process and output (e.g., advisory, blog post, mailing list, catalogs like GSD, CVE)
research documentation/publication options ~3 weeks
test ~2 weeks

* integrate with project/maintainer documentation

Research and decide staffing model, specifically whether and how to use full-time, part-time, and volunteers.  Maybe look at EMT models?

Define operational procedures including processes, tooling, training, and, 
on-call rotation logistics, including a higher-level set of processes around , how we ensure adequate service availability, define volunteering processes & rules, the upholding of commitments upheld by incident responders (including preventing premature disclosure “How-to” guides for those maintainers/developers wishing to engage with the SIRT), service level agreements (SLAs), and the definition a process fore engagement/interactions with Distros, & oss-security & existing security teams. (was 7.1 <-- remove after agreed placement)

Document staff requirements for 1-2 year’s worth of goals

Compensation, incentive, and funding model (as appropriate), w. With a focus on defining compensation and incentives for incident responders as appropriate. Look at f, funding for tooling, compute, and governance. DWe will describe the support staff and comms, and also cover the benefits and guidelines for organizations “donating” staff.

Legal, service level, or contractual details including how to handle volunteers (Samaritan responders, foundation, maintainers), the service level regarding response and engagement times, the contractual details necessary to retain & sustain talent, tools, or services aimed at thein completion of the groups mission. 

### Time and resources estimate
Xx hours volunteer work YEAR xx

## 2.3 Staffing requirements

(was: Define expectations (including vetting process and ethics agreement) and determine the necessary skills and /experience that will be required of each incident responder as part of the SIRT’s processes, onboarding, and shadowing programs.)

Part of the staffing requirements are influenced by selection of services and expected distribution of incidents.

Staff (including volunteers) will be expected to follow rules of engagement and a code of conduct, to include separating OSS SIRT membership and activities from other employer interests. This is covered more in Section 3.

### Key steps and milestones

### Time and resource estimate
Xx hours volunteer work YEAR xx

## 2.4 Engagement criteria
(was: Define conditions and triage criteria for the services offered by the SIRT. This list will be maintained and actively updated in a centralized, public location on the internet.)

Depends on Services and Engagement sections and section 1.*

### Key Steps/Milestones

SIRT SIG/planning committee defines some criteria ~2 months

Initial SIRT staff develop practical criteria, based on planning criteria and final decisions about services, engagement, and resources.
