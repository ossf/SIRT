## 2.1 - Core services

### 2.1.1 Explanation

The SIRT will define the minimum set of core services it will initially offer and propose future service offerings based on the usage, experience, and of the SIRT. This service set will be derived from the output of Section 1 survey. The internal processes and procedures for the SIRT's execution and completion of these services as well as the external guidance for using these services will consider the results of that survey to ensure appropriate communications and engagement paths meet the need of the target user base (open source projects). In order to ensure smooth execution, the SIRT will perform a tabletop exercise and walkthrough of these services and procedures against two different types of open source security incidents.

### 2.1.2 Key steps and milestones

- **M1**: Integrate results of section 1 survey ~1 month
  - [ ] Evaluate the results
  - [ ] Identify common patterns that can feed into one or more services
  - [ ] Define a list of year 1 and year 2 services with prioritization against other services
    - [ ] Intake & Coordination
    - [ ] Security Incident Response Early Notification (SIREN)
    - [ ] Education and Awareness for Researchers and Maintainers (leverage Education SIG)
    - [ ] Others from the survey results

### 2.1.3 Time & Resource Estimate

| Milestone | Estimated Volunteers | Estimated Individual Hours | Estimated Total Hours | Stage |
| :-------: | :------------------: | :------------------------: | :-------------------: | :---: |
|  M1[^1]   |         4-5          |             5              |         20-25         | ➡️ Y1 |

> Estimated Total Combined Volunteer Hours: 20-25

## 2.2 Engagement model

### 2.2.1 Explanation

Dependent upon 2.1 and the survey variability.

### 2.2.2 Key steps and milestones

- **M1**: Estimate operational case distribution for at least first year (~1 month calendar time)

  - [ ] Define the sources of trend data (CNCF, GitHub, MITRE, etc.)
  - [ ] Evaluate 5 year trend of incident types
  - [ ] Group/pattern the incident types that occur leveraging existing body of work

- **M2**: Develop internal SIRT procedures for services ~6 weeks

  - [ ] For each service, define the intake criteria, engagement (whether to do so & prioritization), and closure criteria
    - [ ] Includes initial assessment (triage)
    - [ ] Includes prioritization and risk assessment
  - [ ] For each service, enumerate the procedures, timeliness estimates, and communication expectations ~4 weeks
  - [ ] For each service, define the input and outputs
  - [ ] Publish Playbooks for each service

- **M3**: External facing guidance for services ~3 weeks

  - [ ] For each service, define a tl;dr of what it is
  - [ ] For each service, define a 'why'
  - [ ] For each service, define the expectations a user of the service may reasonably experience with timeline estimates/best effort milestones

- **M4**: Testing period (tabletop some services/procedures/guidance through past incidents) ~3 weeks

  - [ ] Identify two different open source incidents to run through against a service or series of services
  - [ ] Execute the tabletop against the intake, procedures, and communications
  - [ ] Conduct a blameless post-mortem on the execution of the tabletop against the intake, procedures, and communications
  - [ ] Identify refinement areas in the SIRT's execution and update accordingly
  - [ ] Publish post-mortem, corresponding improved areas, and lessons learned in the development of this

- **M5** Define Service level expectations (not strict SLOs)

  - [ ] Includes intake, initial assessment (triage), engagement criteria evaluation (2.4), service selection, assignment, performance of services, tracking/management, closure, reporting, and review
  - [ ] Determine intake routes, availability, and service level expectations
  - [ ] Determine 24/7 coverage? In which time zones?

- **M6**: Decide SIRT event documentation processes and outputs (e.g., advisory, blog post, mailing list, submission to catalogs like GSD and CVE)

  - [ ] Research documentation/publication options (~2 weeks calendar time)
  - [ ] Test (~2 weeks calendar time)
  - [ ] Integrate with project/maintainer security documentation and publication processes

- **M7**: Determine minimal skills and foundational training (supports 3.2 & 3.3)

  - [ ] Inclusive engagement training, etc.
  - [ ] Skills and technical domain expectations for execution of each service

- **M8**: Research existing OSS security mechanisms and notification lists (~1 month calendar time)

  - [ ] Identify existing OSS Security processes/mechanism for potential
  - [ ] Identify existing and missing vulnerability notification lists for redestribution into SIREN
    - [ ] Examples: oss-security, distros, OSS foundations, OSS hosting/infrastructure providers (yes like GitHub)

- **M9**: Determine legal issues, seek advice (from LF/OpenSSF)

  - [ ] Define a list of potential legal concern areas
  - [ ] Contact OpenSSF to ensure the SIRT, maintainers, etc. is covered legally, insurance, codes of conduct, need-to-know, hypocratic oath, etc.

- **M10**: Develop volunteer requirements

  - [ ] Ethical, code of conduct, other agreements
  - [ ] Define volunteering processes & rules, the upholding of commitments upheld by incident responders (including preventing premature disclosure “How-to” guides for those maintainers/developers wishing to engage with the SIRT), service level agreements (SLAs), and the definition a process fore engagement/interactions with Distros, & oss-security & existing security teams.

- **M11**: Re-evaluate processes, criteria, etc. after year 1
  - [ ] For each service, comprehensive assessment on value and usability of the criteria, processes, procedures, communications, etc are determined to continue, modify, or drop

## 2.3 Staffing requirements

### 2.3.1 Explanation

How to staff the SIRT, including volunteer management

Depends on/relates to: 2.1, 2.2

### 2.3.2 Key steps and milestones

- **M1**: Determine staffing structure

  - [ ] Some paid full or part-time staff
  - [ ] Significant proportion of volunteer staff
  - [ ] Flexibility to spin volunteer staff up or down depending on case distribution
  - [ ] Legal and contractual volunteer issues and agreements

- **M2**: Document volunteer vetting process

  - [ ] Consolidate the skills needs and the volunteer requirements

- **M3**: Estimate number of volunteer staff with skill and experience sets

  - [ ] Consider the historical event frequency against the services with time commitment estimates

- **M4**: Re-evaluate staff requirements for 2-3 year’s worth of goals after year 1
  - [ ] Document the year 1 actual time commitments and skills
  - [ ] Identify gaps from year one based on post-mortems of each incident
  - [ ] Compensation, incentive, and funding model (as appropriate), w. With a focus on defining compensation and incentives for incident responders as appropriate. Look at funding for tooling, compute, and governance. DWe will describe the support staff and comms, and also cover the benefits and guidelines for organizations “donating” staff.

[^1]: This estimation is assume this work to be done over the course of a month and is entirely dependent on the quality and content of the survey, it is therefore subject to change.
[^2]: The majority of this work and time will be the development of the detailed steps for each service.
[^3]: This will require finalization by the SIG and require 2 dedicated meetings to finalize.
[^4]: This includes defining where/how notification mailing lists on vulnerabilities could be integrated.
[^5]: This is contigent upon LF legal timelines and availability.
