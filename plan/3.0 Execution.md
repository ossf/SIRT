- Section Meeting Time/Details - Every other Friday 11-11:30am EST :clock11:
- Section Meeting [Zoom](https://zoom.us/j/91969722711)

**Tracking**: TBD - _need placeholder to show progress_

## 3.1 Hire Program Manager for OSS-SIRT

Hire Program Manager(PgM) to oversee the execution of the OSS-SIRT plan, and then facilitate and coordinate the OSS-SIRT as it enters operations. This role will need to be one of the first steps undertaken as the OSS-SIRT plan is being implemented to ensure its smooth delivery. The OSS-SIRT PgM will lead post mortem exercises on incidents to improve efficienmcy and quality of OSS-SIRT outputs, will collect and report out on key metrics of the OSS-SIRT program, will coordinate onboarding and training of new OSS-SIRT volunteers, amongst other duties.

- **M1**: Create job description + roles & responsibilities for OSS-SIRT PgM
- **M2**: Hire PgM
- **M3**: On-board PgM and get them up to speed to start managing plan implementation

## 3.2 - Tech Stack section, deployment and maintenance

The selection of the IT and communications infrastructure is necessary to deliver our services, and make a plan for its deployment, operational availability, and security assurance is included here. That work is dependent on :x: [2.1](https://github.com/ossf/SIRT/blob/main/plan/2.0%20Identify%20Core%20Services%20and%20Processes.md#21---identify-a-core-set-of-services) as it will determine the scope of this work. We can proceed a bit, but will have to wait at some point.

- **M1**: _Tech stack selection_
  - [ ] Discovery and documentation: <https://github.com/ossf/SIRT/issues/9>
  - [ ] Election of tech --# issue#
- **M2**: _Deployment_
  - [ ] For each tool needed (early estimate of 4-5 needed for year one), 20hrs/tool to configure, deploy, integrate, and test
- **M3**: _Operational needs fullfilled_
  - [ ] Annual review of tooling for fit-for-purpose/function

> - Estimated Total Combined Volunteer Hours: 152-200
>   -No estimate available at this time for tooling costs, as testing/review has not been conducted. Wherever possible free and open source tooling will be selected for OSS-SIRT use, but some functions may require commercial products to deliver.

## 3.3 Recruitment

Depending on the operational model defineb by :x: [2.3](https://github.com/ossf/SIRT/blob/main/plan/2.0%20Identify%20Core%20Services%20and%20Processes.md#23-define-expectations-including-vetting-process-and-ethics-agreement-and-determine-the-necessary-skills-and-experience-that-will-be-required-of-each-incident-responder-as-part-of-the-sirts-processes-onboarding-and-shadowing-programs), we will have to hire folks, or recruit volunteers. The actual content of the job requirement will then be defined by :x: [2.1](https://github.com/ossf/SIRT/blob/main/plan/2.0%20Identify%20Core%20Services%20and%20Processes.md#22-define-conditions-and-triage-criteria-for-the-services-offered-by-the-sirt-this-list-will-be-maintained-and-actively-updated-in-a-centralized-public-location-on-the-internet) and :x: [2.4](https://github.com/ossf/SIRT/blob/main/plan/2.0%20Identify%20Core%20Services%20and%20Processes.md#24-design-an-engagement-model-for-incident-responders-which-addresses-things-such-as), so we have lots of blockers here.

- **M1**: Create OSS-SIRT job description
  - [ ] Survey existing CSIRT/PSIRT job descriptions
  - [ ] Per 2.2M10 and 2.3 create draft of role job requirements
- **M2**: Review OSS-SIRT job description
  - [ ] OSS-SIRT SIG members review and edit/update/approve role job description
- **M3** : Post role and talk to Foundation to start vetting process
  - [ ] Consult with TAC and GB to encourage members to supply core of qualifed volunteers
  - [ ] Conduct interviews with candidates
- **M4**: Select initial volunteer cohort
  - [ ] Per 2.3, select candidates to become initial volunteer core for Year One operations of OSS-SIRT
- **M5**: Train/on-board initial volunteer cohort
  - [ ] Per 2.2M6 and 3.3 train initial cohort of volunteers
- **M6**: Annual recruitment/rotation/reeducation of volunteer cohort
  - [ ] Follow 3.2 M3-M5 periodically to refresh pool of viable SIRTers

## 3.4 Documentation and Training for the SIRT

In order to perform the duties of the SIRT properly, we will need both playbooks and onboarding and training materials. This should be addressed early, before we are fully operational so we can iteratively improve on it. The **onboarding** documentation will depend on :x: [2.1](https://github.com/ossf/SIRT/blob/main/plan/2.0%20Identify%20Core%20Services%20and%20Processes.md#22-define-conditions-and-triage-criteria-for-the-services-offered-by-the-sirt-this-list-will-be-maintained-and-actively-updated-in-a-centralized-public-location-on-the-internet) and the **playbooks** will be greatly influenced by :x: [2.4](https://github.com/ossf/SIRT/blob/main/plan/2.0%20Identify%20Core%20Services%20and%20Processes.md#24-design-an-engagement-model-for-incident-responders-which-addresses-things-such-as).

- **M1**: Onboarding documentation v1.0
  - [ ] Develop on-boarding materials
  - [ ] Review materials
  - [ ] Skeleton-draft available to join the SIRT team
  - [ ] Create means to collect areas of improvement for Onboarding documentation
- **M2**: Operational playbooks v1.0
  - [ ] Onboarding documentation
  - [ ] Operations playbooks
- **M3**: Develop outreach and recruiting plan
  - [ ] Per 3.2M6 create recruitment plan
  - [ ] Informed by # of incidents/engagements in Year 1, develop OSS-SIRT workload estimate for growth/expansion

## 3.5 Define and report on key metrics

In order to better understand our successes and impact in YEAR 1 (Y1), we need metrics and reports about the work done. This objective aims to identify Service Level Indicators(SLI), and then measure Service Level Objectives (SLO) ourselves against these. Reports should be presented to the the [TAC](https://github.com/ossf/tac) on a regular basis.

- **M1**: Based off of services OSS-SIRT will deliver, create metrics collection and reporting process
- **M2**: Define reporting channels and key stakeholders
- **M3**: Train OSS-SIRT PgM (3.6 below) in key metrics to track and methods of reporting out
- **M4**: Create quarterly/annual report of OSS-SIRT key metrics
