## 3.1 - Tech Stack section, deployment and maintenance

The selection of the IT and communications infrastructure is necessary to deliver our services, and make a plan for its deployment, operational availability, and security assurance is included here. That work is dependent on :x: [2.1](https://github.com/ossf/SIRT/blob/main/plan/2.0%20Identify%20Core%20Services%20and%20Processes.md#21---identify-a-core-set-of-services) as it will determine the scope of this work. We can proceed a bit, but will have to wait at some point.

- **M1**: _Tech stack selection_
  - [ ] Discovery and documentation: https://github.com/ossf/SIRT/issues/9
  - [ ] Election of tech --# issue#
- **M2**: _Deployment_
  - [ ] ...
- **M3**: _Operational needs fullfilled_
  - [ ] ...


## 3.2 Recruitment

Depending on the operational model defineb by :x: [2.3](https://github.com/ossf/SIRT/blob/main/plan/2.0%20Identify%20Core%20Services%20and%20Processes.md#23-define-expectations-including-vetting-process-and-ethics-agreement-and-determine-the-necessary-skills-and-experience-that-will-be-required-of-each-incident-responder-as-part-of-the-sirts-processes-onboarding-and-shadowing-programs), we will have to hire folks, or recruit volunteers. The actual content of the job requirement will then be defined by :x: [2.1](https://github.com/ossf/SIRT/blob/main/plan/2.0%20Identify%20Core%20Services%20and%20Processes.md#22-define-conditions-and-triage-criteria-for-the-services-offered-by-the-sirt-this-list-will-be-maintained-and-actively-updated-in-a-centralized-public-location-on-the-internet) and :x: [2.4](https://github.com/ossf/SIRT/blob/main/plan/2.0%20Identify%20Core%20Services%20and%20Processes.md#24-design-an-engagement-model-for-incident-responders-which-addresses-things-such-as), so we have lots of blockers here.

## 3.3 Documentation and Training for the SIRT

In order to perform the duties of the SIRT properly, we will need both playbooks and onboarding and training materials. This should be addressed early, before we are fully operational so we can iteratively improve on it. The **onboarding** documentation will depend on :x: [2.1](https://github.com/ossf/SIRT/blob/main/plan/2.0%20Identify%20Core%20Services%20and%20Processes.md#22-define-conditions-and-triage-criteria-for-the-services-offered-by-the-sirt-this-list-will-be-maintained-and-actively-updated-in-a-centralized-public-location-on-the-internet) and the **playbooks** will be greatly influenced by :x: [2.4](https://github.com/ossf/SIRT/blob/main/plan/2.0%20Identify%20Core%20Services%20and%20Processes.md#24-design-an-engagement-model-for-incident-responders-which-addresses-things-such-as).

- **M1**: Onboarding documentation v1.0
  - [ ] Skeleton-draft available to join the SIRT team
  - [ ] Create means to collect areas of improvement for Onboarding documentation
- **M2**: Operational playbooks v1.0
  - [ ] issue1 - Onboarding documentation
  - [ ] issue2 - Operations playbooks

## 3.4 Define and report on key metrics

In order to better understand our successes and impact in year one1, we need metrics and reports about the work done. This objective aims to identify (Service Level Indicators), and then measure (Service Level Objectives) ourselves against these. Reports should be presented to the the [TAC](https://github.com/ossf/tac) on a regular basis.

- **M1**: Based off of services OSS-SIRT will deliver, create metrics collection and reporting process
- **M2**: Define repoprting channels and key stakeholders
- **M3**: Train OSS-SIRT PgM (3.6 below) in key metrics to track and methods of reporting out
- **M4**: Create quarterly/annual report of OSS-SIRT key metrics
  - [ ] issue1


## 3.5 Establish a post mortem culture

Documenting lessons learned from handled incidents in order to mature the Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure processes (CVD) with feedback provided to other working groups such as the Best Practices WG, Vuln Disc WG and other existing organizations operating in the incident response world.

- **M1**: Create post mortem process for after-action reviews as well as reflection upon major incidents
- **M1a**: Create psot mortem feedback survey for participants in incidents
- **M1b**: Create post mortem executive summary report for sharing with key stakeholders after post mortem is concluded
- **M2**: Train OSS-SIRT PgM (3.6 below) to facilitate post mortem process and stakeholder feedback collection

## 3.6 Hire Program Manager for OSS-SIRT

Hire Program Manager(PgM) to oversee the execution of the OSS-SIRT plan, and then facilitate and coordinate the OSS-SIRT as it enters operations.  This role will need to be one of the first steps undertaken as the OSS-SIRT plan is being implemented to ensure its smooth delivery.  The OSS-SIRT PgM will lead post mortem exercises on incidents to improve efficienmcy and quality of OSS-SIRt outputs, will collect and report out on key metrics of the OSS-SIRt program, will coordinate onboarding and training of new OSS-SIRT volunteers, amongst other duties.

- **M1**: Create job description + roles & respsoniblities for OSS-SIRt PgM
- **M2**: Hire PgM
- **M3**: On-board PgM and get them up to speed to start manging plan implementation
