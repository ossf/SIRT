# The Problem

The next world-altering critical open-source software vulnerability like [Heartbleed](https://heartbleed.com/) or
[Log4Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log4Shell) is almost certainly already existing, undiscovered, somewhere in our codebases
today. When these vulnerabilities are eventually discovered by either a friendly researcher
or a malicious threat actor, open-source maintainers need to make quick decisions that
can dramatically impact the cybersecurity posture of entire industries. With this in mind,
it is sobering to realize that in the event of a cybersecurity emergency on an under-re-
sourced project, there is often nowhere to which open-source software maintainers can
turn for well-vetted, highly-available, expert security vulnerability remediation support.
Consequently, developers are suddenly (and sometimes unknowingly) indirectly responsible
for an industry-wide security risk, and have no choice but to try to remediate it alone â€”
often without the specialist security knowledge and coordinated disclosure connections to
do so safely.

In May of 2022, the OpenSSF developed a 10 stream plan to address this and several other ecosystem-wide security topics as part of the [Open Source Software Security Mobilization Plan](https://openssf.org/oss-security-mobilization-plan/). Stream 5 set forth the initial framework to Establish an OpenSSF Incident Response Team of security experts to assist open source projects accelerate their responses to newly discovered vulnerabilities. This work was adopted by the OpenSSF's [Vulnerability Disclosure Working Group](https://github.com/ossf/wg-vulnerability-disclosures) and the plan was reformed into this document from July 2022 through November 2022.

This plan lays out the first two years of a roadmap to develop a cohort of trustworthy, vendor-neutral, vetted, well-orchestrated and experienced group of security professionals that will partner with open source projects, maintainers, security researchers, and the industry ecosystem to help ensure good coordinated vulnerability disclosure practices are used through out open source and downstream communities. As the team develops and as tooling, process, and connections are put into place, this team of vounteers will be able to assist open source developers and security researchers collaborate more effectively as security vulnerabiltiies are reported, coordinated, and ultimately addressed in open source software. The plan is organized into three sections:

- [1.0 Understand the Problem Space](https://github.com/ossf/SIRT/blob/main/plan/1.0%20Understand%20the%20problem%20space.md) that focuses in on existing communities and processes for sharing and resolving security vulnerabilties
- [2.0 Identify Core Services](https://github.com/ossf/SIRT/blob/main/plan/2.0%20Identify%20Core%20Services%20and%20Processes.md) where the desired capabilties that the OSS-SIRT will offer as services to the community are researched and mapped out
- [3.0 Execution](https://github.com/ossf/SIRT/blob/main/plan/3.0%20Execution.md) where the plan is executed on with the volunteer corps being oboarded, trained, and supported by expert staff.
